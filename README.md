README.md
What better moment first-time build a Hackintosh if not in a full-blown pandemic? 

This repository aims to walkthrough the process of building my Hackintosh - including the EFI folder and sharing the components I used. I'm daily-driving this with macOS Big Sur 11.2 and I have everything working.  

Booloader: **OpenCore 0.6.6**
macOS: Big Sur 11.2
